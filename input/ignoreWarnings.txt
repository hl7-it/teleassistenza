For the complex type CodeableConcept, consider using a pattern rather than a fixed value to avoid over-constraining the instance
There are multiple different potential matches for the url 'http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/patient-birthPlace'. It might be a good idea to fix to the correct version to reduce the likelihood of a wrong version being selected by an implementation/implementer, or use the [IG Parameter `pin-canonicals`](https://hl7.org/fhir/tools/CodeSystem-ig-parameters.html). Using version '5.3.0-ballot-tc1', found versions: 4.0.1, 5.2.0, 5.3.0-ballot-tc1. Suggested fix: change the canonical reference from 'http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/patient-birthPlace' to 'http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/patient-birthPlace|5.3.0-ballot-tc1'
The value set expansion is too large, and only a subset has been displayed
There are multiple different potential matches for the url 'http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v2-0203'. It might be a good idea to fix to the correct version to reduce the likelihood of a wrong version being selected by an implementation/implementer, or use the [IG Parameter `pin-canonicals`](https://hl7.org/fhir/tools/CodeSystem-ig-parameters.html). Using version '5.0.0', found versions: 4.0.0, 5.0.0. Suggested fix: change the canonical reference from 'http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v2-0203' to 'http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v2-0203|5.0.0'

The resource ActivityDefinition/actdef-teleass could usefully have an OID assigned (OIDs are easy to assign - see https://build.fhir.org/ig/FHIR/fhir-tools-ig/CodeSystem-ig-parameters.html#ig-parameters-auto-oid-root)

HL7 Defined CodeSystems should ensure that every concept has a definition
The extension http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/regex|5.2.0 is deprecated with the note: 'This was deprecated in favor of using a constraint on the element using FHIRPath, since constraints allow for the provision of a human readable message associated with the regex'
The extension http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/iso21090-SC-coding|5.2.0 is deprecated with the note: 'Replaced by [[[http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/iso21090-codedString]]]'
The extension http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/elementdefinition-maxValueSet|5.2.0 is deprecated
The discriminator type 'pattern' is deprecated in R5+. For future compatibility, you could consider using type=value with a pattern[x] instead (if this is not an inherited slicing)
The resource status 'draft' and the standards status 'trial-use' may not be consistent and should be reviewed
